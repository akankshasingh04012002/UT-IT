# UT-IT
Assignment Overview:-

This assignment consists of three parts. In the first part, we have  write a code to check the strength of a provided password. In the second part, we have  create a separate class to check for duplicate elements in a list and finded the factorial of a given number. In the third part,  have wrriten unit  test cases for three classes, namely User Validation Class, Company Validation Class, and Email Validation Class.

Part 1: Password Strength Checker


I have  implemented a code to check the strength of a provided password. The password is considered strong if it follows the following constraints:

The string must contain uppercase and lowercase letters.
The string must have alphanumeric characters as well as special characters, but the only allowed special characters are {%@#&$}.
The password must not contain the user's name.
We have to take input from the user for the user's full name, user's email, and user's password. We also have to use loggers in each of the functions we create with proper definition and handle errors in each case if necessary.

Also have followed the TDD approach to write the code and test cases.

Part 2: List of Elements and Factorial


I have create a separate class to check for duplicate elements in a list and find the factorial of a given number.Also wrritten unit test cases for these functionalities.

Part 3: Unit  Test Cases


I have written unit  test cases for three classes, namely User Validation Class, Company Validation Class, and Email Validation Class. We have to add validation in these classes as follows:

User Validation Class:

Checked if the company exists in the database.
Checked if the email id is valid.

Company Validation Class:

Company should not already exist in the database.
Checks if the email id is valid.

Email Validation Class:

Checks if the email is valid.
Also have create test cases for all the classes except the case classes in the model package.Also have used ScalaStyle with proper indentation and alignment.

Conclusion:-

In conclusion, this assignment consists of three parts, where have  written a code to check the strength of a provided password, create a separate class to check for duplicate elements in a list and find the factorial of a given number, and written unit test cases for three classes.Also used loggers and ScalaStyle with proper indentation and alignment.
